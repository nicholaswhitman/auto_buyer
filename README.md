# auto_buyer
Automates the purchase of items on best buy website using implicit wait for the specific element to exist. This allows for faster iterations depending on your resources. 


Started this project in 2021 so I could buy GPU at MSRP during the ERA of Covid19 that resulted in distribution disruptions, scalpers buying out the market and flipping for a higher price, and crypto miners buying out GPUs resulting in great demand and 2x nearly 3x the MSRP price.


Not continuing this project until I see a practical need. 
It was fun to learn how to use python and selenium to automate purchases. The issue was not being able to find a solution for email confirmation codes and plug it back into the website.
